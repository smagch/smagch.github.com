I was quite surprised at [css3 3D transform demos](http://www.webkit.org/blog/386/3d-transforms/) on the webkit.org
What is really amazing is that the demos has no update function for frame animation but css definitions for animations.

I just created simple mouse interactive css3 3D transform demo.

_NOTE_: <strong>The demo only support certain computers which has GPU acceleration with webkit browser, safari and chrome.</strong>

it's not bad at all because DOM element can receive mouse events, although the performance will be better with HTML5 canvas.
