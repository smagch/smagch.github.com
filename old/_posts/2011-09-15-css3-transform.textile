title: Webkit css3 3D transform
---

I was quite surprised at "css3 3D transform demos":http://www.webkit.org/blog/386/3d-transforms/ on the webkit.org
What is really amazing is that the demos has no update function for frame animation but css definitions for animations.

I just created simple mouse interactive css3 3D transform demo.
_NOTE_: <strong>The demo only support certain computers which has GPU acceleration with webkit browser, safari and chrome.</strong>


<iframe src="/demo/css3-transform-centering-demo.html" scrolling="no" style="display: block; border: none; margin: 0 auto; height: 400px; width: 100%;" ></iframe>

it's not bad at all because DOM element can receive mouse events, although the performance will be better with HTML5 canvas.
